### Why don’t you provide a ready to use DataTable component?

This is actually a feature! We want to give you the freedom of how you want to 
generate the cell matrix and how you want to react to data changes. 
Feel free to use our tutorial example to implement your own DataTable component.

### What alternatives do I have?

There are plenty of nice products out there which also integrate well with React. 
Here a short and certainly incomplete list in no particular order:

1. agGrid
2. Handsontable
3. Kendo UI (DataGrid or Spreadsheet)
4. DevExtreme
5. Bryntum
